REVAMP TO MAKE IT UPTODATE AND PRESENTABLE

* use cachemap in the project
* and pheap for TTL, with a alarm job to evict the expired objects if their expiry elapsed
* also per element lock
* all locks will be LockKing rwlock
* try to put Slabby somewhere in it
* use ConnMan and Cutlery's stream api for parsing with compression and ssl
  * possibly get json to work somehow
