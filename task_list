 * setup multi class lru_cache
 * each lru cache is a 2 linkedlist of free data and used data
 * only used data of the same size bump eachother, the more used on comes to head
 * for eviction, we pick the data from the tail of the list
 * we can malloc until a predefined memory size is not reached
 * use a heap to allow expiry based eviction
 * use cutlery datastructures as much as possible, replace them where ever possible

 * reduce client public headers required for installation
 * add up arrow for client_shell to be used easily
