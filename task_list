 * write test cases for cashed_hashtable

 * optimize parsers
 * use snprintf_dstring for serialization of query and result

 * make it single threaded like redis i.e. a global read write mutex on cashed_hashtable
 	* there are 2 additional threads 1 for expiry manager
 	* for removing lru objects and freeing memory
 * also manage clean up from the lru
 * use Sloppy for slab allocation of the cashed_data
 * hastable expansion and auto detection an expansion is required
