 * replace hash function appropriately, with accurate implementation

 * also manage clean up from freelist and the lru

 * hastable expansion and auto detection an expansion is required

 * add up arrow for client_shell to be used easily, using queue of last 100 commands

 * write test cases for cashed_hashtable

 * write less copy / concatenate_dstring function calls in parsers for server and client
 * (as observed n codebase parsers are relying heavily on copying characters, use empty unallocated dstring (.bytes_allocated = 0) etc for the purpose)
 * use snprintf_dstring for serialization
 * need direct read to dstring based read and recv and send calls (to avoid multiple copies)
